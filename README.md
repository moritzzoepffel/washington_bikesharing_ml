# Bikesharing in Washington

This repository contains the data and code for the [Bikesharing in Washington](https://www.kaggle.com/pronto/cycle-share-dataset) Kaggle competition. The goal of the competition is to predict the number of bike rentals in Washington, D.C. based on weather and other data. The data is provided by [Pronto](https://www.prontocycleshare.com/), a bike sharing system in Seattle, WA. The data is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pronto/cycle-share-dataset). The data is also available on [Pronto's website](https://www.prontocycleshare.com/datachallenge).
