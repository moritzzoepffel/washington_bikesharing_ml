# Bikesharing in Washington

This project is based on the data from this [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset). This dataset contains the hourly count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system in Washington, DC with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. The goal of this project is to predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period.
